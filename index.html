      <p> one fine day , Asusual I'm on my way to college And the thing is i don't know there'll be placementy drive in my college.After reaching college all of sudden i was called for the participation in Drive.
      Actually i don't have a phone to write the test so i took the phone from lab assistant (humble mam>and wrote the exam. Written the test and called out name that i have passed the exam.Excited !!
      </p>
      <p2>Next round is the group discussion, I'm glad that i have been passed the 2nd round also.and next round is based on programming,so i am weak in programming and i'm nervous of this exam.I hve written the exam and Gave my best in it.
      The results time ,I was shocked !!!when the results came everyone got zero and i got 3 marks out of 25(not a great thing).and the Institute not expected this from our side.They expected Best from us .so based on the aptitude and verbal,coding exam 
      they have conducted in college shortlisted a student 1 out of 15 and the student will be trained free for 6 months and also can get a job based on his performance in the institute.and the student was ME !!!!!
